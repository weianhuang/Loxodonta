This is our final release. Explore the rooms to find the different colored keys and unlock the correspondingly colored doors. Keep in mind, you may have to kill the key enemy to steal their key! In some rooms you are required to kill all the enemies to continue; these are specified by the purple enemy door. Find the victory room to beat the level. Collect peanuts to replenish your health and stay alive as long as you can. Enjoy our ten levels displaying different levels of difficulty.
