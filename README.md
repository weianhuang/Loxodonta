## Concept

Hundreds of light-years from the Earth, thousands of creatures from 
around the galaxy are being held captive in an alien research facility. 
However, one elephant, Test Subject L427, isn’t ready to give up yet! 
Help her carve a path to freedom by whacking the alien guards with a 
huge leaf and dashing into them with a speedy hoverboard, all while 
avoiding hazards and collecting as many peanuts as she can eat.
